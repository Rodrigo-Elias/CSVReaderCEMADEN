# CSVReaderCEMADEN

This is a simple CSV reader and xml converter made in javascript for the use of the metereological department of the city of Maric√°, from the state of the Rio de Janeiro / Brazil.

It reads a CSV file that separate it's columns by ';' and apply the raw data result firs in a table, where the user is able to filter some data by city name and day.

He can later get a result table (pre mounted now because of accentuation of some names in portuguese) where it correlates the station with the day to get te amount of rain that happened that day

Works fine, and can be improved a lot. Going to be back soon on this one.
